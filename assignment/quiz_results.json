      "question": {
        "question": "What is the friendship paradox?",
        "answer": "The friendship paradox is the observation that most people have more friends than the average person. This is because popular friends appear more frequently in the friend list of others.",

      },
      "llm_answer": "The friendship paradox is a counterintuitive observation in social networks: on average, people have more friends than their friends do. This doesn't mean people are universally popular, but rather that the distribution of friend counts in a network is skewed, with a few individuals having a disproportionately large number of connections.\n\nThe paradox arises from the way we count friendships. When calculating the average number of friends a person has, we\u2019re essentially summing up the number of friends each person has and dividing by the total number of people. Because high-degree individuals (those with many friends) are referenced more often by others, they contribute more to this average than low-degree individuals.  Low-degree individuals are less likely to be mentioned by their friends, leading to an inflated average friend count for those with many connections.\n\nMathematically, this can be illustrated with an example. Consider a small network. If Bob has three friends, and each of those friends has, on average, 2 friends, then Bob's average degree is (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1. However, if Bob has 3 friends, and each of those friends has, on average, 4 friends, then Bob's average degree is (3 * 4) / 3 = 4.\n\nThe friendship paradox has significant implications beyond just a quirky observation. In public health, it\u2019s used in \u201cacquaintance immunization,\u201d a strategy where instead of vaccinating everyone directly connected to an infected person (as in contact tracing), public health officials target the friends of those friends \u2013 individuals who are more likely to be connected to a wider network. This approach can be more efficient in slowing the spread of an epidemic.  It also applies to other networks, such as scientific collaboration networks, where your co-authors tend to have more collaborators than you do, and the internet, where websites with more incoming links are more prominent.  Understanding this bias is crucial for analyzing and modeling social and information networks.",

      "evaluation_explanation": "The student's answer accurately describes the friendship paradox as the observation that most people have more friends than the average person, and correctly attributes this to popular individuals being counted more often in the friend lists of others.\n\nThe LLM's answer also correctly explains the friendship paradox, providing a more detailed explanation of the skewed distribution of connections in social networks. It further elaborates with mathematical reasoning and real-world applications like public health and scientific collaboration networks.\n\nBoth the student's answer and the LLM's answer are factually correct and provide a good understanding of the friendship paradox.",

      "question": {
        "question": "What is the degree of a node in a network?",
        "answer": "The total transmission routes removed equals the sum of degrees of all vaccinated nodes. For example, if you vaccinate nodes with degrees [5, 3, 7], you remove 5+3+7=15 transmission routes. This metric is useful because: (1) It directly measures the network's transmission capacity reduction; (2) It's simple to calculate and compare across strategies; (3) It captures the intuition that removing high-degree nodes has disproportionate impact; (4) It provides a clear optimization target for vaccination strategies; (5) It scales appropriately with network size and density, making it useful for comparing strategies across different network types.",
